# ABOUT ME

Hi — I'm **Shaiyaoh**.  
I'm 20 years old, building this entire system **alone**, on a single laptop, with no funding, no team, and no institutional backing.  

I am not an expert in machine learning.  
I’m not a researcher with access to clusters or proprietary models.  
I’m not a company.

What I *am* is someone who saw a missing idea —  
a way to bind **video perception**, **memory**, and **symbolic structure** into a single cognitive interface —  
and decided to build it from first principles.

I am an engineering physics dropout.  
Everything in this repo comes from pure intuition, experimentation, and thousands of hours of prompting, architecting, refining, and breaking things until they worked.

I didn’t train a model.  
I didn’t fine-tune anything.  
I didn’t rely on massive infrastructure.

I built Tonious using:
- lightweight open-source models  
- prompt-driven constraints  
- a symbolic Tree-of-Life memory layer  
- a perception pipeline I designed myself  
- a UI I wired together alone  
- and a vision for where AI agents need to evolve next  

This project began as an attempt to build a *direct-perception cognitive system* — something that can watch the world, convert experience into structure, and recall it coherently.

I know there are gaps.  
I know this architecture isn’t perfect or finished.  
But everything here is real, built by one person, and running on everyday hardware.

If Tonious feels unusual, different, or strangely alive in its structure — that’s because it wasn’t built from the usual blueprints.  
It was built the only way I knew how:  
**by pushing until something new emerged.**

Thanks for reading,  
— **S.**
